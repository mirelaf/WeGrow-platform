# WeGrow-platform
______________________________

After originating in a hackathon, WeGrow is a currently in planning phase.

It's a garden sharing platform connecting garden owners who don't have time to look after their gardens or need some extra help, with interested individuals around, to share workload, harvest, and meet like-minded individuals.

This simplified, first version app is being built with Ruby with Sinatra and SQLite3, and includes a Google Maps Javascript API where users can view posted gardens on a map.

Members (and admin) can view, edit, add, show, hide and delete garden and user profiles.
